<div class="auto-style7" style="width: 1486px; height: 1715px">
	<span class="auto-style9">We are Zziwa Muhammed and friends, a team of 
	legends ﬁnishing S.4 this year. If you ever wondered what happens when you 
	mix books, laughter, pool table, action movies, jokes, and a bit of madness… 
	well, that’s us ӭ.</span><br class="auto-style9" />
	<span class="auto-style9">School life for us has never been just about 
	reading and exams. It has been about memories, friendship, and the little 
	dramas that make each day unforgettable</span>.<br />
	˸<span class="auto-style10"> <span class="auto-style11">The Crew</span></span><br />
	<span class="auto-style12">Mugaya Roghny</span> <span class="auto-style13">
	<strong>&nbsp;<br />
	R– the chief joker. Honestly, if laughter was a subject on the UNEB 
	timetable, Roghny would have an A+ with distinction. His jokes have rescued 
	us from boring prep sessions, serious teachero mods, and even exam tension.<br />
	</strong></span><br />
	<span class="auto-style14">Kizito Juma </span>–<br />
&nbsp;<span class="auto-style15">the master of teasing. He can pick the smallest 
	mistake you made and turn it into a whole comedy show. Even when you try to 
	get angry, you end up laughing until tears drop.<br />
	<br />
	</span><br />
	<span class="auto-style14">Nkalubo Michel<br />
&nbsp;</span><span class="auto-style15">– the storyteller. If there’s a new 
	“friend story” in school, just sit down and listen. He narrates with so much 
	energy that even teachers want to join in.<br />
	<br />
	</span><br />
	<span class="auto-style14">Kakooza Edrine </span>–<br />
	<span class="auto-style15">&nbsp;the action movie director ɂ. Every story he 
	tells feels like a Hollywood ﬁlm, full of explosions, car chases, and 
	kung-fu kicks. If life had sound effects, Edrine would provide them himself.<br />
	</span><br />
	<span class="auto-style14">Eddy Mwenye</span><br />
&nbsp;<span class="auto-style15">– the “serious” one. He likes to act mature and 
	strict… but two minutes later, you ﬁnd him laughing with us like he never 
	meant it. We’re still waiting for the day he’ll actually be serious for 
	real.<br />
	</span><br />
	<span class="auto-style14">Musis Ibrahim</span> <br />
	<span class="auto-style15">– the ladies’ man. When he walks, even the wind 
	knows he’s thinking about girls. His friends say if Ibrahim had a diary, it 
	would just be a list of crushes ӷ.<br />
	<br />
	</span><br class="auto-style16" />
	<span class="auto-style16">Kibirango Edrine<br />
	</span>&nbsp;<span class="auto-style15">– pool table and ludo master. This 
	guy doesn’t just play, he dominates. Losing to him is almost a school 
	tradition at this point.<br />
	<br />
	</span><br />
	<span class="auto-style14">Sematimba Godfrey</span> –<br />
&nbsp;<span class="auto-style15">same pool and ludo energy. When he and Mwenye 
	team up, just know the game is already over. The rest of us are just there 
	for decoration.<br />
	</span><br />
	<span class="auto-style14">Kawemba John –<br />
	<br />
	</span>&nbsp;<span class="auto-style17">the “Breaking News” reporter ΃. He 
	can tell you about a story that doesn’t even exist. Sometimes he lies so 
	well that even he starts to believe himself. But honestly, that’s</span><br class="auto-style17" />
	<span class="auto-style17">what makes him fun — the whole crew ends up 
	laughing.<br />
	</span><br />
	<span class="auto-style14">Lukungu Swabulu (Kisige)</span> –<br />
&nbsp;<span class="auto-style15">our nickname champion. If jokes were money, 
	Kisige would be the richest in Uganda. His timing is perfect — just when 
	everyone is silent, boom, he drops a joke that ﬁnishes us.<br />
	</span><br />
	<span class="auto-style14">Amuli Mubarack –<br />
	</span>&nbsp;<span class="auto-style15">yet another man of gals. Together 
	with Ibrahim, they run the “department of love affairs.” If you want advice 
	on girls, don’t ask teachers, just ask Amuli.</span><br />
